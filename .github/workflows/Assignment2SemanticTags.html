        <h1><u>History</u></h1>
        <p>The current Red Bull team can trace its origins back to the Stewart Grand Prix outfit that made its debut in 1997.
            Red Bull, an energy drinks company, agreed its purchase of Jaguar racing on the final day 
            of the sale. Red Bull Racing was not the start of Red Bull's involvement in Formula One,
             as they sponsored Sauber from 1995 to 2004.

        <h1><u>Cosworth Engines</u></h1>
        <p>Red Bull Racing used Cosworth engines in its maiden year due to

        <h1><u>Ferrari Engines</u></h1>
        <p>On 23 April 2005, the team announced a deal to utilise customer Ferrari
            engines in 2006. This coincided with a rule change mandating the use of V8 engines,
            making it likely that both Red Bull racing and Ferrari would use the same specification engine.
            <details>
                V8 engine is an eight- cylinder piston engine in which two banks of four cylinders
                share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration.
